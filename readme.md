This is a quiz in building a basic site in Rails with Capybara!

```
       _        _
      (\\.-""-.//)
       /        \    /)
       \o      o/   ((
       /\      /\    ))
      /==\ () /==\  //
     |    `UU`    |//
     |            |/
   .-'\          /'-.
  (((` ) |----| ( `)))
      (((`    `)))
```

To run the tests from the project's folder

```
$ rake rspec
```

The spec file is in `quiz_app_1/spec/features/welcome_spec.rb`

The tests have been commented out.

You can uncomment the tests by selecting them in Sublime and typing `cmd + /`

To make the tests pass you'll have to build out the rest of the app.
